  <p>Hi, my name is Fatta (He/Him)</p>
  <p>I started studying digital media because I wanted to expand my knowledge of digital design, I always have a passion in designing especially digital design, so I wanted to move from my business and economics backgroudn to pursue something new</p>
  <p>I spend a lot of time watching movies, and playing video games</p>
  <p>My favourite emoji is : clown emoji or the Moia stone face</p>
  <p>My personal experience with sound is that I took sound design class last semester, and I'm always intrigued on how sound works in games and movies on how they are able to build tension or create mood for the audience<!-- elaborate as much as you like --></p>
  <p>I have zero to none prior experience working with code, but I'm willing to give it my all in exploring this new journey<!-- elaborate as much as you like --></p>
